## Purpose
**_easy-rest-test_** enables you to provide a REST service within minutes based on a few given .csv files.
Extend your REST service by just adding additional .csv files ...

## Usage
There are only a few steps you need to follow:

- Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:stefanwalther/easy-rest-test.git`)
- Do an `npm install`
- Place the .csv file you want to expose through REST in the `./data/` folder.
- Start the service by running `npm run start`

Your .csv files are now exposed as a REST endpoint, e.g.:

- The content of the file `./data/sales-data.csv`
- Is now available at `http://localhost:3000/sales-data`

## Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

### Reserved endpoints

- `<server-url>/health-check` - Health check for the entire service.
- `<server-url>/api-docs` - Swagger / OpenAPI documentation (not implemented, yet).

### Endpoints based on the files your are providing

For each of the datasets (right now only .csv files) you have provided, the following endpoints are exposed:

- `<server-url>/:dataset` - e.g. http://localhost:3000/sales-data for the file `./data/sales-data.csv`.
- `<server-url>/file/:dataset` - to download the entire file.

## Deployment
The entire idea of this solution is to deploy a REST service with some basic data (e.g. for testing purposes) within less than a minute:

<details>
<summary><strong>Using Heroku</strong></summary>
Assuming that you have cloned the repository, follow these steps to deploy your basic REST service:

- Make sure you have a Heroku account
- Create a new heroku app
- Give it a name, e.g `my-rest-service`
- Create the app (`Create app`)
- Under your newly created app, `Deploy`, choose `Deployment method` and select `GitHub`
- Enter the name of your GitHub repository and then click `Connect`
- That's it, deploy your service by
  - `Enable Automatic Deploys` or
  - manually using `Deploy Branch`
- Access one of your data-sources by hitting e.g `https://my-rest-service.herokuapp.com/sales-data`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using docker</strong></summary>
(TBD)
</details>

## File-Types
Right now only `.csv` files are supported and placed into the `./data` folder.

### Conventions for .csv files

- The .csv file contains a header
- The .csv file uses semicolon (`;`) as a delimiter

## Roadmap
This is currently a very early iteration of the basic idea of "exposing .csv files through REST".  
[Any feedback is very appreciated!](https://github.com/stefanwalther/csv-to-rest/issues)  
So far the following additions are planned:  

- [ ] (feat): Error handling in case of invalid .csv files
- [ ] (feat): Expose datasets via OpenApi/Swagger
- [ ] (feat): HATEOAS links
- [ ] (feat): In memory storage of datasets
- [ ] (feat): Support paging
- [ ] (feat): Support different authentication methods
- [ ] (ci): Docker Image
- [x] (ci): CircleCI Tests
- [ ] (test): More integration tests
- [ ] (docs): Instructions how to deploy within minutes to heroku & Co.
- [ ] (test): Coverage report
