# csv-to-rest

> Serve some .csv files via a REST service in a few minutes.

---

## Purpose
**_csv-to-rest_** enables you to provide a REST service within minutes based on a few given .csv files.
Extend your REST service by just adding additional .csv files ...

## Usage
There are only a few steps you need to follow:

- Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:stefanwalther/csv-to-rest.git`)
- Do an `npm install`
- Place the .csv file you want to expose through REST in the `./data/` folder.
- Start the service by running `npm run start`

Your .csv files are now exposed as a REST endpoint, e.g.:

- The content of the file `./data/sales-data.csv`
- Is now available at `http://localhost:3000/sales-data`

## Roadmap
This is currently a very early iteration of the basic idea of "exposing .csv files through REST".
[Any feedback is very appreciated!](https://github.com/stefanwalther/csv-to-rest/issues)
So far the following additions are planned:

- [ ] Error handling in case of invalid .csv files
- [ ] Expose datasets via OpenApi/Swagger
- [ ] HATEOAS links
- [ ] In memory storage of datasets
- [ ] Support paging
- [ ] Support JWT authentication
- [ ] Docker Image
- [ ] CircleCI Tests
- [ ] Instructions how to deploy within minutes to heroku & co.
