This is currently a very early iteration of the basic idea of "exposing .csv files through REST".
[Any feedback is very appreciated!]({%= bugs.url %})
So far the following additions are planned:

- [ ] Error handling in case of invalid .csv files
- [ ] Expose datasets via OpenApi/Swagger
- [ ] HATEOAS links
- [ ] In memory storage of datasets
- [ ] Support paging
- [ ] Support JWT authentication
- [ ] Docker Image
- [ ] CircleCI Tests
- [ ] Instructions how to deploy within minutes to heroku & co.
